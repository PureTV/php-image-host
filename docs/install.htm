<h3>Installing Php Image Host</h3>
<p>
    <strong>PHP Image Host REQUIRES php 5 or greater and the gd image library</strong>
</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to install your copy of Php Image Host:</p>

Create a mysql database on your site to use with Php Image Host. If you do not know how to do this ask 
your web hosting company.
</li>

<li>
    Unzip the phpimagehost.zip archive to an empty folder on your computer.
</li>
<li>
    Edit the "/includes/db.conf.php.sample" file with your own database settings and
    save it as "/includes/db.conf.php".
</li>
<li>
Upload the contents of the phpimagehost archive to your web server.
</li>
<li>
Set the permissions on the &quot;<strong>/images</strong>&quot; &quot;<strong>/thumbs</strong>&quot;
and &quot;<strong>/temp</strong>&quot; directories so that php scripts can write to them. 
<br /><br />
If your server is apache and has mod_rewrite enabled you should also create a file called <strong>.htaccess</strong>
in the root directory of your installation and set the permissions on that file so the script can 
write to it too.<br /><br />
This is required to support bandwidth monitoring and search engine friendly urls.
file so that the script can create the rules in this file for monitoring image bandwidth and search
engine friendly urls.
<br /><br />

</li>
<li>
    If you entered the correct database settings in the db.conf.php file above
    you should see the installation screen. If you get error messages about the
    database then check your database settings in the <strong>/includes/db.conf.php</strong> file.
    <br /><br />
    If you get other errors then please ask for help in the <a href="http://forum.phpace.com/">support forum</a>.
</li>

<li>
